# Building Auto-Regressor Model for Time-Series Analysis Using Rolling Window : End to End Pipeline
<Objective : Description of both parts>
## Introduction to Time-Series Data

<write from google, ppt>



## Technologies used

* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Flask


## Modular code overview


## Model Deployment 

This section of the project demonstrates the process of creating an automated MLOps Pipeline for end to end ML development to design, build and manage reproducible, testable ML models on GCP (Google Cloud Platform).

### Introduction to MLOps (write 2-3 lines from ppt or maybe some diagram for arch)
  
  
### Running Flask application on Docker and Depoying on Kubernetes
 <update requirements file>

   
### Building Application on GCP 
   write steps from google
   <cloud build>
    <create trigger for auto push>
      
    <create topic on cloud pub/sub>
      
      <cloud function>
        
        <k8s engine>
